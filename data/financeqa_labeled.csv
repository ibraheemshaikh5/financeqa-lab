The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Change in Operating Working Capital: $1,000 million**

Operating working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities, and the change reflects the increase in cash potential based on 2% of revenue from 2023 to 2024.",WRONG_METRIC_OR_CONCEPT,"The model's answer of $1,000 million for the change in operating working capital is incorrect. The actual answer is -$182 million. The model's explanation suggests a misunderstanding of the calculation of operating working capital, as it mentions 'increase in cash potential based on 2% of revenue,' which is not a standard method for calculating changes in operating working capital. This indicates a confusion between metrics or concepts, as operating working capital should be calculated as the change in current assets minus current liabilities, not based on a percentage of revenue."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Gross Profit: $27,095 million.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Operating Current Assets in 2024: $34,246 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"24.4%

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Diluted EPS: $16.56**

To calculate fully diluted shares outstanding, we start with the basic shares outstanding (444,759,000) and add the effect of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The weighted average of RSUs granted was 1,337,000, and the total diluted shares are 444,759,000 + (1,337,000 * (average stock price - exercise price) / average stock price). Since the exercise price is not provided, we assume it does not significantly affect the total, leading to a diluted share count of approximately 444,759,000. Thus, the diluted EPS is calculated as Net Income Attributable to Costco ($7,367 million) divided by diluted shares (444,759,000).",MISSING_OR_WRONG_ASSUMPTION,"The model's answer of $16.56 for Diluted EPS is incorrect compared to the actual answer of $16.53. The model makes an assumption that the exercise price does not significantly affect the total diluted shares, which is a critical assumption that can impact the calculation. Without the exercise price, the model's assumption leads to an incorrect calculation of diluted shares and thus an incorrect EPS. This falls under MISSING_OR_WRONG_ASSUMPTION as the model's assumption about the exercise price is not validated and leads to an incorrect result."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Members Churned in 2024: 4,800**

remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"P/E Ratio: 56.67

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**WACC = 8.36%**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Adjusted EBIT: $9,285 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"ROE = 31.2%

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Average Invested Capital: $30,056 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities in 2023: $24,258 million.**

The model calculated the net long-term assets by subtracting total long-term liabilities from total long-term assets, resulting in $24,258 million.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Book Value of Equity in 2024: $23,622 million.** This represents the total equity of Costco Wholesale Corporation as reported on the balance sheet for the year ended September 1, 2024.",CORRECT,"The model's answer correctly states the Book Value of Equity in 2024 as $23,622 million, which matches the actual answer provided.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"$280.5 million

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023
Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16
Gross increases—current year tax positions 3 1
Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11
Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years —

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Variable Lease Liability Estimate: $163 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Change in Variable Lease Assets: -$1,000 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Accounts Receivables Days for 2024: **11.5 days**

The correct formula for Accounts Receivables Days is (Average Accounts Receivable / Total Revenue) * 365. The model's calculation seems to follow this formula, but the result of 11.5 days does not match the actual answer of 3.59x.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core

pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

this cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but
not yet delivered.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"444,759,000

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Invested Capital (2023): $25,058 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Net Operating Deferred Tax Asset in 2023: $1,685 million**

The model calculated the net operating deferred tax asset as $1,685 million by subtracting $1,989 million (deferred tax liabilities) from $2,107 million (deferred tax assets). However, the correct calculation should be $2,107 million - $1,989 million = $118 million, not $1,685 million.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Operating Profit for 2024: **$9,285 million**.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Revenue per store (2024):**

Additionally, the model's answer uses a total revenue figure and divides it by the total number of warehouses, which is not the same as providing revenue per store by geography. This indicates a misunderstanding of the metric required by the question."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**EBITDA Margin: 3.70%**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"$2,426 million.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Unlevered Beta: 0.66**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Net Debt: $5,991 million**

The model's calculation uses total debt of $5,897 million and cash of $9,906 million, leading to a negative net debt, which is not possible given the actual answer.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"$2,375 million. 

This amount represents the long-term operating lease liabilities reported in Costco's balance sheet for 2024.",WRONG_METRIC_OR_CONCEPT,"The model's answer of $2,375 million refers to the long-term operating lease liabilities, which is a specific component of long-term liabilities. However, the question asks for the operating portion of long-term liabilities, which is $456 million. The model confuses the specific component with the broader category, leading to the wrong metric being used."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Sales per sq ft (2024):**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"ROA = 10.55%

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Operating Profit Margin: **3.72%**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**ARPU = $3,335.45**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight

The calculation provided by the model is incorrect. The total debt is $5,794 million + $103 million = $5,897 million, and the total equity is $23,622 million. The correct calculation for the debt to equity ratio is $5,897 million / $23,622 million = 0.2495, which is approximately 24.95% when expressed as a percentage, not 0.25 or 2.73%. The model's arithmetic is incorrect, leading to the wrong ratio."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"5%

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Operating tax in 2024: **$2,373 million**.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023
Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16
Gross increases—current year tax positions 3 1
Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11
Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years —

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Variable Lease Assets: $163 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**EV/EBITDA Ratio for 2024: 24.05**

To calculate this, we first determine EBITDA: Operating Income ($9,285M) + Depreciation and Amortization ($2,237M) = $11,522M. Next, we calculate the market value of equity: Stock Price ($940) × Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (444,759,000) = $418,471M. Finally, we estimate Enterprise Value (EV) as Market Value of Equity ($418,471M) + Total Debt ($5,794M) - Excess Cash ($9,906M) = $414,359M. Thus, EV/EBITDA = $414,359M / $11,522M = 24.05.",CORRECT,"The model's answer correctly follows the steps to calculate the EV/EBITDA ratio. It accurately computes EBITDA by adding Operating Income and Depreciation and Amortization. It then calculates the market value of equity using the stock price and fully diluted shares outstanding. The enterprise value is correctly adjusted for total debt and excess cash. The final EV/EBITDA ratio calculation is consistent with the provided numbers and methodology, resulting in 24.05, which is the model's answer. The discrepancy with the actual answer (35.44x) suggests a difference in assumptions or inputs not detailed in the question, but the model's calculation is internally consistent and follows the correct methodology."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**EBIT Interest Coverage Ratio: 54.92**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**EBIT: $9,285 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Cost of Equity = 9.83%

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Invested Capital (excluding Goodwill) for 2024: $23,622 million.**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Operating Profit Margin: 3.71% (2024) vs. 3.35% (2023) - Yes, the Operating Profit Margin increased from 3.35% in 2023 to 3.71% in 2024.",CORRECT,"The model's answer correctly states that the Operating Profit Margin increased from 3.35% in 2023 to 3.71% in 2024, which aligns with the actual answer 'Yes'.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023
Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16
Gross increases—current year tax positions 3 1
Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11
Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years —

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Customer Retention Rate: 92.9%**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Adjusted EBITDA Margin: 4.06%**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**ROIC: 10.59%**

ROIC is calculated as Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT) divided by Invested Capital; for 2024, NOPAT is $7,367 million (net income) adjusted for taxes, and Invested Capital is the sum of total equity and net debt.",WRONG_METRIC_OR_CONCEPT,"The model's answer of 10.59% for ROIC is incorrect compared to the actual answer of 25.33%. The model's explanation indicates a misunderstanding of the components involved in calculating ROIC. It mentions using NOPAT as net income adjusted for taxes, which is not the standard approach. NOPAT should be operating income after tax, not net income. Additionally, the model does not provide details on how it calculated Invested Capital, which could also contribute to the discrepancy. This indicates a confusion in the metrics or concepts used in the calculation."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF) for 2024: $1,565 million.**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %
The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Change: -$1,066 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities in 2024: $1,042 million.**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"$1,911.77

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Equity Value: $373.79 billion**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Net Operating Deferred Tax Asset: $1,781 million**

However, the correct answer is a negative $535 million. This discrepancy suggests that the model may have used incorrect figures or misunderstood the concept of netting deferred tax assets and liabilities, leading to a fundamentally different result.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"$29,032 million

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Operating Cash Tax in 2024: $2,319 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities: -$1,000 million.**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Statutory Tax Rate: 21%**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"$3,936 million.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Asset Turnover = 3.64

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Excess Cash: $7,626 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special

• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Debt for 2024: $6,897 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023
Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16
Gross increases—current year tax positions 3 1
Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11
Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years —

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**EV/Sales Ratio: 0.25**

To calculate the EV/Sales ratio, we first need to determine the enterprise value (EV) and then divide it by total sales. The EV is calculated as market capitalization plus total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Given the stock price of $940, shares outstanding of 443,126,000, total debt of $5,794 million, and cash of $9,906 million, the EV is approximately $417,000 million, leading to an EV/Sales ratio of 0.25 when divided by total sales of $254,453 million.",ARITHMETIC_ERROR,"The model's calculation of the EV/Sales ratio is incorrect. The model states that the EV is approximately $417,000 million and divides it by total sales of $254,453 million to get an EV/Sales ratio of 0.25. However, dividing $417,000 million by $254,453 million should result in an EV/Sales ratio of approximately 1.64, not 0.25. This indicates an arithmetic error in the model's calculation."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Operating Current Liability: $35,464 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**EBITA Interest Coverage Ratio: 55.00**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Operating Working Capital (2023): $4,454 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new

merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Operating Cash Tax Rate: **24.4%**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Unadjusted EBITDA: $12,522 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Estimated Variable Lease Assets in 2023: $1,433 million.** This figure represents the finance lease assets, which are included in the total lease assets on the balance sheet.",ARITHMETIC_ERROR,"The model's answer provides an estimate of $1,433 million for Variable Lease Assets in 2023, while the correct answer is $1,405 million.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Equity to Value in 2024: **33.8%**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Adjusted EBITDA: $12,822 million.**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"24.4%

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight

However, the calculation is incorrect. The average inventory should be calculated as ($16,651 million + $18,647 million) / 2 = $17,649 million. The Inventory Turnover should then be $222,358 million / $17,649 million = 12.6x, which matches the actual answer. The model's answer of 13.39 is incorrect due to an arithmetic error in calculating the average inventory or the final division."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023
Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**UFCF: $8,626 million**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"Debt to Value: **0.66**

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Operating Working Capital (OWC) for 2024: $8,646 million.** 

This is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities, adjusted for the maximum potential operating cash of $4,991 million (2% of revenue).",WRONG_METRIC_OR_CONCEPT,"The model's answer of $8,646 million for Operating Working Capital (OWC) is incorrect compared to the actual answer of -$6,844 million. The model incorrectly calculates OWC by adjusting for the maximum potential operating cash of $4,991 million, which is not a standard adjustment for OWC. OWC is typically calculated as current assets minus current liabilities without such adjustments. This indicates a misunderstanding of the OWC concept."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",basic,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"5,200.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**Enterprise Value (EV) for 2024: $66,074 million**

To calculate EV, we use the formula:  
EV = Market Value of Equity + Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents.  

1. **Market Value of Equity**:  
   - Stock Price = $940  
   - Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = 444,759,000  
   - Market Value of Equity = $940 * 444,759,000 = $418,471 million  

2. **Total Debt**:  
   - Current Portion of Long-Term Debt = $103 million  
   - Long-Term Debt = $5,794 million  
   - Total Debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million  

3. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:  
   - Cash = $9,906 million  

4. **Calculate EV**:  
   - EV = $418,471 million + $5,897 million - $9,906 million = $414,462 million  

Thus, the final Enterprise Value is $66,074 million, reflecting the company's total value considering its equity, debt, and cash.",ARITHMETIC_ERROR,"The model's calculation of Enterprise Value (EV) is incorrect due to an arithmetic error. The model correctly calculates the Market Value of Equity as $418,471 million, Total Debt as $5,897 million, and Cash and Cash Equivalents as $9,906 million. However, when calculating EV, the model states: EV = $418,471 million + $5,897 million - $9,906 million = $414,462 million, but then incorrectly concludes that the EV is $66,074 million. The correct EV should be $414,462 million, not $66,074 million. This discrepancy indicates an arithmetic error in the final step of the calculation."

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",assumption,Costco,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,"**NOPAT for 2024: $7,367 million**

NOPAT is calculated as net income attributable to Costco, which is $7,367 million, adjusted for one-time items such as the special dividend and tax benefits, which are not included in the operating income.",WRONG_METRIC_OR_CONCEPT,"The model's answer incorrectly uses net income attributable to Costco as the basis for NOPAT calculation. NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax) should be derived from operating income, not net income, and should exclude non-operating items like special dividends and tax benefits. The model's approach reflects a misunderstanding of the NOPAT metric, leading to a different result from the actual answer."
